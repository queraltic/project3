PROJECT 3
On this project we had to choose a place for having our new statup.
I look for the places has the most startups ot tech companies that included: Palo Alto, London ans Boston
Things to know: 

1. The list of requirements that should be considered was the following:

"You recently created a new company in the GAMING industry. The company will have the following scheme:

20 Designers
5 UI/UX Engineers
10 Frontend Developers
15 Data Engineers
5 Backend Developers
20 Account Managers
1 Maintenance guy that loves basketball
10 Executives
1 CEO/President.  
You have to find a place that more or less covers all the following requirements (note that it's impossible to cover all requirements, so you have to prioritize at your glance):

Designers like to go to design talks and share knowledge. There must be some nearby companies that also do design.
- 30% of the company staff have at least 1 child. 

- Developers like to be near successful tech startups that have raised at least 1 Million dollars.

- Executives like Starbucks A LOT. Ensure there's a starbucks not too far.

- Account managers need to travel a lot.

- Everyone in the company is between 25 and 40, give them some place to go party.

- The CEO is vegan.

- If you want to make the maintenance guy happy, a basketball stadium must be around 10 Km.

- The office dogâ€”"Dobby" needs a hairdresser every month. Ensure there's one not too far away."


 2. Things I choosed for the company are:

 2.1. Starbucks
 2.2. Parks for the ones that has children.
 2.3. Airports
 2.4. Night clubs
 2.5. Vegan Restaurants


The tool I used was the Foursquare API. Using it, I could map specific locations around a certain point.   


I looked as i said before for the tree cities and the most acurated is London, that has a lot of possibilities.
